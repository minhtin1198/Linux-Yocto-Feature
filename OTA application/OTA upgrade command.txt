Hi aVu! 
This is the status of this task:
1. Workload: 5 man hours
2. Status: WIP
```
1.2.Check how to upgarde a package that already be installed in device.
```
I checked the yocto project, which supports an upgraded method for application packages using the dnf package. 
```
The dnf package. 
Software package manager that installs, updates, and removes packages on RPM-based Linux distributions. It automatically computes dependencies and determines the actions required to install packages.
```
Here are the steps for performing an upgrade. 
1.Enable the upgrade feature in the source code by adding the configs into the local.conf
```
+IMAGE_FEATURES += " package-management"

+PACKAGE_FEED_URIS = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

2.Build the package upgrade.
-Build the full image by using the following command:
```
$  bitbake imx-image-full
```
-Generate the package index for upgrade by using the following command:
```
$ bitbake package-index
```

3.Copy the update package into the USB Flash. 

```
$ cp -rf {YOCTO_ROOT_DIR}/build-se36/tmp/deploy/rpm/ /media/<username>/usb
```

4. Flashing the image into the device.

5. Plug the USB flash into the device.

6.  Start a package feed URI on the rpm folder from USB flash
```
$ mount /dev/sdb /media
$ python3 -m http.server --directory /media/rpm
```
 7. Perform  the upgrade by using the following command:
```
$ dnf makecache
$ dnf upgrade
```

Next action:
I will create the design document for upgraded application packages from USB flash.
The estimated schedule is Jun 11
The workload is 4 man hours.

Thanks,
Tin Nguyen
